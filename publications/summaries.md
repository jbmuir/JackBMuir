### Probabalistic lowermost mantle P-Wave tomography from hierarchical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and model parametrization cross-validation

The structure of the Earth is dominated by three primary interfaces --- the surface, the Core-Mantle Boundary (CMB), and the Inner Core boundary. The Core-Mantle Boundary is potentially the most interesting of these, because it strongly controls the heat flux from the core, and hence has wide ranging implications for flow in the mantle and the generation of Earth's magnetic field. The area of the mantle just above the CMB is known as the lowermost mantle and is particularly complex. In this study, we used recent developments in imaging science to provide constraints on just how complex the lowermost mantle is, using a unique dataset that was particularly sensitive to short lengthscale structures. We found that our data required increased short lengthscale complexity compared to existing datasets, suggesting a "patchier" lowermost mantle than is often assumed.  

### Geometric and Level Set Tomography using Ensemble Kalman Inversion

Tomography refers to the process by which we infer the hidden internal structure of an object by sending energy through it, rather than by destructive testing. Most people would be familiar with the medical CT scan (computed tomography) which uses the attenuation of x-rays through the body to create detailed, non-invasive images. We can use a similar idea to create images of the interior of the earth using seismic waves; however because the imaging geometry and propagation physics are much less favorable than in the medical setting, seismic images are much harder to interpret. We propose a method of simplifying the way that seismic images are described during tomography, to make them more robust and interpretable. We use a mixture of explicit geological features such as faults, and boundaries between geological units described implicitly by a mathematical object known as a level set. This allows us to image sharp features much more cleanly than using traditional seismic techniques. 


### Did Oldham Discover the Core After All? Handling Imprecise Historical Data with Hierarchical Bayesian Model Selection Methods

One of the most important developments of early 20th century Earth science was determination that the Earth was made up of multiple layers with wildly different physical characteristics. Probably the most important study during this period was R.D. Oldham's 1906 paper, which synthesised observations of multiple earthquakes at seismometers across the world to build a comprehensive picture of how long it took seismic waves to travel through the deep Earth. On the basis of analysing this data, Oldham correctly proposed that the Earth had a core, distinct from the material above it. However, it turned out that while Oldham's conclusions were correct, his analysis was totally wrong, and in fact used data that had nothing to do with the core --- however, part of his data may have been sufficient to "discover" the core correctly, had Oldham analysed it appropriately. We use this significant (and fun) historical dataset to develop new statistical techniques for treating historical seismic data, which is often riddled with imprecision and errors. In doing so, we found that Oldham did in fact have sufficient data to discover the core after discarding his incorrect analyses, and provided a useful tool to the geophysical community for treating historical data.

### A single-probe-beam double-heterodyne polarimeter-interferometer for plasma Faraday rotation measurements

Commercial nuclear fusion has long been a holy grail of clean energy production, promising to totally replace baseline fossil fuel generators and providing a useful counterbalance to fickle wind and solar. However, despite much promise, fusion has proven to be an engineering nightmare, and so has yet to realize its potential. One of the key considerations for fusion production is accurate metrics of the internal state of the plasma inside the generator. The plasma is the burning fuel of fusion, analagous to ignited gasoline in an internal combustion engine. As an undergraduate research project, we developed a novel microwave-based sensor for determining the physical properties of a test plasma. Of note was that we were an early adopter of 3D printing for custom scientific equipment, in this case a particular microwave-optical element of the sensor.
