  abstract = {Historical seismic data are essential to fill in the gaps in geophysical knowledge caused by the low rate of significant seismic events. Handling historical data in the context of geophysical inverse problems requires special care, due to the large errors in the data collection process. Using Oldham's data for the discovery of Earth's core as a case study, we illustrate how a hierarchical Bayesian model selection methodology using leaveone-out cross validation can robustly and efficiently answer quantitative questions using even poor-quality geophysical data. We find that there is statistically significant evidence for the existence of the core using only the P-wave data that Oldham effectively discarded in his discussion.},

  abstract = {Tomography is one of the cornerstones of geophysics, enabling detailed spatial descriptions of otherwise invisible processes. However, due to the fundamental ill-posedness of tomography problems, the choice of parametrizations and regularizations for inversion significantly affect the result. Parametrizations for geophysical tomography typically reflect the mathematical structure of the inverse problem. We propose, instead, to parametrize the tomographic inverse problem using a geologically motivated approach. We build a model from explicit geological units that reflect the a priori knowledge of the problem. To solve the resulting large-scale nonlinear inverse problem, we employ the efficient Ensemble Kalman Inversion scheme, a highly parallelizable, iteratively regularizing optimizer that uses the ensemble Kalman filter to perform a derivative-free approximation of the general iteratively regularized Levenberg\textendash Marquardt method. The combination of a model specification framework that explicitly encodes geological structure and a robust, derivative-free optimizer enables the solution of complex inverse problems involving non-differentiable forward solvers and significant a priori knowledge. We illustrate the model specification framework using synthetic and real data examples of near-surface seismic tomography using the factored eikonal fast marching method as a forward solver for first arrival traveltimes. The geometrical and level set framework allows us to describe geophysical hypotheses in concrete terms, and then optimize and test these hypotheses, helping us to answer targeted geophysical questions.},

  abstract = {The problem of decomposing irregular data on the sphere into a set of spherical harmonics is common in many fields of geosciences where it is necessary to build a quantitative understanding of a globally varying field. For example, in global seismology, a compressional or shear wave speed that emerges from tomographic images is used to interpret current state and composition of the mantle, and in geomagnetism, secular variation of magnetic field intensity measured at the surface is studied to better understand the changes in the Earth's core. Optimization methods are widely used for spherical harmonic analysis of irregular data, but they typically do not treat the dependence of the uncertainty estimates on the imposed regularization. This can cause significant difficulties in interpretation, especially when the best-fit model requires more variables as a result of underestimating data noise. Here, with the above limitations in mind, the problem of spherical harmonic expansion of irregular data is treated within the hierarchical Bayesian framework. The hierarchical approach significantly simplifies the problem by removing the need for regularization terms and user-supplied noise estimates. The use of the corrected Akaike Information Criterion for picking the optimal maximum degree of spherical harmonic expansion and the resulting spherical harmonic analyses are first illustrated on a noisy synthetic data set. Subsequently, the method is applied to two global data sets sensitive to the Earth's inner core and lowermost mantle, consisting of PKPab-df and PcP-P differential traveltime residuals relative to a spherically symmetric Earth model. The posterior probability distributions for each spherical harmonic coefficient are calculated via Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling; the uncertainty obtained for the coefficients thus reflects the noise present in the real data and the imperfections in the spherical harmonic expansion.},

  abstract = {Bayesian methods, powered by Markov Chain Monte Carlo estimates of posterior densities, have become a cornerstone of geophysical inverse theory. These methods have special relevance to the deep Earth, where data are sparse and uncertainties are large. We present a strategy for efficiently solving hierarchical Bayesian geophysical inverse problems for fixed parametrizations using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, and highlight an effective methodology for determining optimal parametrizations from a set of candidates by using efficient approximations to leave-one-out cross-validation for model complexity. To illustrate these methods, we use a case study of differential traveltime tomography of the lowermost mantle, using short period P-wave data carefully selected to minimize the contributions of the upper mantle and inner core. The resulting tomographic image of the lowermost mantle has a relatively weak degree 2\textemdash instead there is substantial heterogeneity at all low spherical harmonic degrees less than 15. This result further reinforces the dichotomy in the lowermost mantle between relatively simple degree 2 dominated long-period S-wave tomographic models, and more complex short-period P-wave tomographic models.},

  abstract = {We study the crustal structure of southern California by inverting horizontal-to-vertical (H/V) amplitudes of Rayleigh waves observed in noise cross-correlation signals. This study constitutes a useful addition to traditional phase-velocity-based tomographic inversions due to the localized sensitivity of H/V measurements to the near surface of the measurement station site. The continuous data of 222 permanent broadband stations of the Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN) were used in production of noise cross-correlation waveforms, resulting in a spatially dense set of measurements for the southern California region in the 1\textendash 15 s period band. The fine interstation spacing of the SCSN allows retrieval of high signal-to-noise ratio Rayleigh waves at periods as low as 1 s, significantly improving the vertical resolution of the resulting tomographic image, compared to previous studies with minimum periods of 5\textendash 10 s. In addition, horizontal resolution is naturally improved by increased station density. Tectonic subregions including the Los Angeles basin and Salton trough are clearly visible due to their high short-period H/V ratios, whereas the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges exhibit low H/V at all periods.},
